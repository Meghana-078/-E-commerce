This is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB for the backend.
Users can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders. Admins can manage products, view user orders, and update order statuses.
The site also supports admin and user authentication, and each user can download a PDF receipt of their orders. 
The UI uses soft pastel colors for a clean and friendly design.
